        The 4 seasons colour analysis theory is based on four colour types: <strong>Spring</strong>,
        <strong>Summer</strong>, <strong>Autumn</strong> and <strong>Winter</strong>. Which
        seasonal type you are depends on two basic variables:
    </p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <ul class="d-inline-block text-left my-4" id="criteria">
            <li class="mb-2"><i class="far fa-gem accent-colour mr-3"></i>the undertone of your skin, hair and eyes
                (warm/golden vs cool/ashy)</li>
            <li><i class="far fa-gem accent-colour mr-3"></i>how light vs deep your overall colouring and specifically
                your hair is</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        The seasons represent the four possible variations of these two variables: If your natural hair colour is
        lighter than medium brown, you would be typed as either a Spring or a Summer; if itâ€™s darker you are a
        Winter or an Autumn. If your skin tone and hair have a warm undertone, or you are a natural red-head, you
        would be classed as either a Spring or an Autumn; if your skin has a blue-ish, cool undertone and your hair
        is more ashy and has no golden or red highlights, you are either a Summer or a Winter.
        When you know your beauty type, you can then choose colours of makeup that is most flattering for you!
