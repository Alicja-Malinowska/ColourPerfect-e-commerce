    <p>
        The 4 seasons colour analysis theory is based on four colour types: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Which
        seasonal type you are depends on two basic variables:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the undertone of your skin, hair and eyes (warm/golden vs cool/ashy)</li>
        <li>how light vs deep your overall colouring and specifically your hair is</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The seasons represent the four possible variations of these two variables: If your natural hair colour is
        lighter than medium brown, you would be typed as either a Spring or a Summer; if itâ€™s darker you are a
        Winter or an Autumn. If your skin tone and hair have a warm undertone, or you are a natural red-head, you
        would be classed as either a Spring or an Autumn; if your skin has a blue-ish, cool undertone and your hair
        is more ashy and has no golden or red highlights, you are either a Summer or a Winter. When you know your
        beauty type, you can then choose colours of makeup that is most flattering for you!
