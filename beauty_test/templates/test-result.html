                {% if result == "Spring" %}
                Spring women have these same chromatic characteristics, so you work by repetition, by harmony.

                It is the most varied palette, both as a type of women and as colors: we will find both beige /
                apricot
                and blue, but always warm and bright. Enemy colors: gray and black.

                What sets them apart from summer, but also from autumn women, is the fact that they hold up strong
                colors very well, thanks to their typically radiant complexion.

                {% elif result == "Summer" %}
                Summer women typically have delicate colors: they can be blondes, but also with light brown hair.

                Pastel, powdery and mother-of-pearl shades suit them very well.

                On the other hand, colors that are too vivid and aggressive, especially in warm and orange shades,
                are not good at all on them.

                {% elif result == "Autumn" %}
                Even the autumn palette is quite heterogeneous: we go from brunettes like Madalina Ghenea to blondes
                like Nicole Richie, passing by redhead like Julia Roberts.

                What they have in common is the warm undertone and above all the medium-low intensity: apart from
                the Deep sub-group (Madalina Ghenea), which also look good with stronger colors, the others will
                prefer the soft tones of autumn woods and the colors of spices.

                WARNING! Brown hair does not mean an autumn: if you do not like beige, if the shades of green make
                you uncomfortable and orange is your enemy, then you are not part of this group!

                {% else %}
                It is the most widespread season, at least in our parts and in the Mediterranean basin in general.

                It includes the olive-skin and black hair women (Salma Hayek), but also those with lighter skin and
                gem eyes (Megan Fox).

                The Cool type (Natalie Portman) is very tricky because it has more delicate colors and has a
                medium-low intensity. It’s easy to put it in the autumn group for her brown hair, but as I said
                “brown hair does not mean autumn”; so stay focused on his porcelain skin and the fact that orange
                and beige are her enemies.
