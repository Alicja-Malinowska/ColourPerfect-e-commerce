            <p>
                Do you remeber that time when you saw that perfect lipstick shade on your friend's lips, so you rushed
                to
                the shop to buy the exactly the same one, and when you did it turned out it did not look so perfect on
                you? We have all been there, and trust us - there is nothing wrong with you! Your friend probably had a
                different beauty type than you, and would not look great in a shade tha makes you look like a million
                dollars! The key is to find out what your beauty type is and what colours will help you to highlight
                your natural beauty. That being said, it does not mean that particular colours are definitely off limits
                for you! It is rather about finding the right shade of the colour.
