The page navigation is designed to be intuitive and enable a user to perform required actions quickly and easily. The website offers many ways to view offered products, so that it is easy for user to find what they look for. There are also many suggestions, if the user does not exactly know what they look for. 

The main focus and a quality that distinguishes ColourPerfect from other e-commerce make-up websites, are colours. Therefore logo was designed to be colourful and [Magonia Grove Color Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/91838) was used. Also, the first colour from this palette (#fc4f6f) became a theme colour (buttons, footer, links etc are in this colour). The background colour is white so that all the colours are well presented and the main focus is on them. 

### Colour matching

The idea of colour matching to different beauty types comes from the four seasons analysis. According to this theory there are 4 main types of beauty: spring, summer, autumn and winter. Different colours match better with those beauty types. Generally more vivid, and light colours (juicy, fruity colours) are better for the spring type, vivid but dark colours are recommened for autumn types, calmer and dark colours are suggested for winter types, and finally - calmer and light colours (pastels) are good match for the summer type. This is of course very generalised. 

Having this knowledge, I looked into different colour representations (e.g hex, rgb, hsl) to see which would be the best to use in an algorithm that can determine which beauty type is a match for given colour. In a simplified version warm colours are for warm types (spring and autumn) and blue colours are for cold types (winter and summer). However, this is a big simplification, since, for example, blue is considered a cold colour, however some shades can have warmer undertones and look much better on warm beauty types (e.g. marine blue is recommended for the autumn types). For this reason, dividing colours in a simple way, such that those that have bigger red value are warm and those with bigger blue value are cold, would not be sufficient and would return incorrect results, even additionally differentiate lighter colours from darker shades. Therefore, I looked into hsl values and how the colours change when one of the three values is changed. I used [the w3schools hsl page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_hsl.asp#:~:text=HSL%20Color%20Values&text=Hue%20is%20a%20degree%20on,100%25%20is%20the%20full%20color.) for that. I noticed that hue value is not a criterion, for the similar reasons why division to cold and warm colours was not sufficient. However, saturation and lightness seemed to be the key values that could be used to determine which of the four categories a colour belongs to. After a bit of experimentation, I noticed that if saturation is very low, the colours are less vivid and would only match winter or summer, depending on their lightness. If the saturations is very high, still the darkest colours would be right for winter, and the lightest - for summer, but the majority of shades will be a match for autumn (darker) and spring (lighter). Based on these observation, I built a simple algorithm that assigns a given colour to one of the 4 seasons, based on its s and l values. 

This is not based on any scientific research, and the colour matching is only a guidance. The treshold values were set by me, based on my experimentation and observations, not any existing formulas, as there aren't any - to the best of my knowledge. As the colour matching is only a suggestion, the algorithm seems to be good enough to suggest suitable colours, and should be sufficient for this project. 

### Wireframes

Wireframes for the homepage:

![desktop](https://github.com/Alicja-Malinowska/ColourPerfect-e-commerce/blob/master/wireframes/desktop-home.png)

All the wireframes can be found in the [wireframes folder](https://github.com/Alicja-Malinowska/ColourPerfect-e-commerce/tree/master/wireframes).

#### Differences between wireframes and the application

* Navbar links and buttons - in wireframes login/logout and register/your account are navigation links, however in the project these actions are available in user drop down menu situated next to the basket and wishlist. This is a better solution because it allows to keep all the actions connected to the user's account in one place and the navigation links are only connected to the specific content pages.

* Navbar layout - in wireframes this is spanned across two rows in desktop view, however eventually I chose to have everything in one row as there was enough space to do this and there was no need to make the navbar take more space. In the mobile view, the basket is in the bottom row together with search field(this expands when clicked on), wishlist button and user account drop-down. Again, the space was enough so I decided this was a better user experience where all those actions are next to each other. 

* Beauty test - all the questions are displayed at once, instead one by one, with next button, like in the wireframes. There are only 5 questions, and the top content is not as big as expected so it felt like a better user experience to display all the questions at once. 


## Features

All the features were added to enhance the UX and make the website easy to use and intuitive to move around. 

### Existing Features

* **Fixed navbar**

  This element appears on all the pages. It contains a clickable logo that takes user to the homepage, and links to the remaining pages, as well as a search box, where user can search for products. The navbar is expanded on large devices and on smaller ones it is collapsed, however search box, account, basket and wishlist links are still visible. When the hamburger menu is clicked a the remaining navbar links appear. When a user clicks a link the navbar collapses back. 

* **Footer**

  Like navbar, this element also appears on all the pages. It contains a Delivery&Returns link, which takes user to the delivery section of the about page. Apart from that, there is a clickable customer service number, and social icon links (these only link to social media main pages, as the shop is no real and does not have any social pages). The footer stick to the bottom of the page regardless the size of the page and the size of the footer itself (which changes on different devices).

#### Login&Authentication system

  Django Allauth was used to provide login and authentication functionality to the project. 

* **Registration**

  - When 'Register' link is clicked on the navbar, a user is taken to the registration form page, where they can complete registration form, or click a link to the login page instead
  - When the registration form is submitted and it's valid, a user receives an email with verification link, otherwise - an error message shows informing user why the form has not been submitted
  - User is automatically logged in when registration is successful

* **Login**

- When 'Login' link is clicked on the navbar, a user is taken to the login form page, where they can complete login form, or click a link to the registration page instead; they can also login with their Google account or request password reset
- If login details are correct, a user is logged in, otherwise error message appears
- User can reset their password clicking 'Forgot password' button
- 'Sign in with Google' buttons allows to sign in with Google account, without creating an account in the application

* **Logout**

- When logout link is clicked, a modal appears informing about the email address the user is currently logged in and asking for confirmation to log out, if it is confirmed - the user is logged out

User can also change their password and manage their emails from their profile view.
