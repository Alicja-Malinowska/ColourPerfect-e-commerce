The main focus and a quality that distinguishes ColourPerfect from other e-commerce make-up websites, are colours. Therefore logo was designed to be colourful and [Magonia Grove Color Palette](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/91838) was used. Also, the first colour from this palette (#fc4f6f) became a theme colour (buttons, footer, links etc are in this colour). The background colour is white so that all the colours are well presented and the main focus is on them. 

### Colour matching

The idea of colour matching to different beauty types comes from the four seasons analysis. According to this theory there are 4 main types of beauty: spring, summer, autumn and winter. Different colours match better with those beauty types. Generally more vivid, and light colours (juicy, fruity colours) are better for the spring type, vivid but dark colours are recommened for autumn types, calmer and dark colours are suggested for winter types, and finally - calmer and light colours (pastels) are good match for the summer type. This is of course very generalised. 

Having this knowledge, I looked into different colour representations (e.g hex, rgb, hsl) to see which would be the best to use in an algorithm that can determine which beauty type is a match for given colour. In a simplified version warm colours are for warm types (spring and autumn) and blue colours are for cold types (winter and summer). However, this is a big simplification, since, for example, blue is considered a cold colour, however some shades can have warmer undertones and look much better on warm beauty types (e.g. marine blue is recommended for the autumn types). For this reason, dividing colours in a simple way, such that those that have bigger red value are warm and those with bigger blue value are cold, would not be sufficient and would return incorrect results, even additionally differentiate lighter colours from darker shades. Therefore, I looked into hsl values and how the colours change when one of the three values is changed. I used [the w3schools hsl page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_hsl.asp#:~:text=HSL%20Color%20Values&text=Hue%20is%20a%20degree%20on,100%25%20is%20the%20full%20color.) for that. I noticed that hue value is not a criterion, for the similar reasons why division to cold and warm colours was not sufficient. However, saturation and lightness seemed to be the key values that could be used to determine which of the four categories a colour belongs to. After a bit of experimentation, I noticed that if saturation is very low, the colours are less vivid and would only match winter or summer, depending on their lightness. If the saturations is very high, still the darkest colours would be right for winter, and the lightest - for summer, but the majority of shades will be a match for autumn (darker) and spring (lighter). Based on these observation, I built a simple algorithm that assigns a given colour to one of the 4 seasons, based on its s and l values. 

This is not based on any scientific research, and the colour matching is only a guidance. The treshold values were set by me, based on my experimentation and observations, not any existing formulas, as there aren't any - to the best of my knowledge. As the colour matching is only a suggestion, the algorithm seems to be good enough to suggest suitable colours, and should be sufficient for this project.
